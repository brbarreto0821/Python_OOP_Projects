## General info
Python projects and activities that I made using object oriented programming. Some of the projects were made from a book by Dusty Phillips.
	
## Technologies
Each project was created with Python version 3.7.6

## Features
#### GradingSystem
* Outputs a basic grading system with made up data

#### LinkCollector
* Outputs a list of links that each HTML file contains in the folder

#### MachineLearningRGB
* Teaches a program about colors when using color.py
* Creates a csv file that contains color data when finishing using color.py
* output.py outputs the color data that was created from color.py and creates a csv file of the data
* test.py checks to see if the program knows what color is what by asking the user if a color is that specific color

#### MailingListManager
* Manages the list of email messages from email addresses
* Creates a list of emails when activating mailing.py

#### PasswordValidator
* Checks if a password is Strong or Weak
* The password has requirements (must have one capital letter, two special characters, and two numbers)

#### SalesDatabase
* Creates a database about car sales
* query.py prints out the data and creates a file with the data
* database.py creates the database that contains the car sales data

## Setup
To run these projects, you must have Python 3(I used Python 3.7.6) or an app that can run .py files.
Each folder will have a README.txt file to show you how to use them.

## Sources
Some of these projects were made from a book called _Python 3 Object Oriented Programming 3rd Edition_ by Dusty Phillips. This book helped me
understand how to fully utilise the power of object oriented programming in Python.
